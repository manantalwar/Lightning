prisma/.env stores our connection url. 
Store the Postgres URL here.

It will be encrypted during generation later

prisma/schema.prisma stores the body of our transitioning code

datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

Must turn into:

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

npx prisma db pull --force //This command will pull the basic layout of data in the schema

Package server (and URI) with: npx primsa generate

Now the Server may be executed with: npm start
